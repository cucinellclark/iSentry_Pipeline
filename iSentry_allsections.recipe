#below is the header: this must be included in this order at the top of the file
Bootstrap:library
From: ubuntu:18.04
Stage: build

#all other sections below can appear in any order
#however, they will be executed in the order below when building the container

#first executed on the host system outside of the container after the base OS has been installed
#container file system is reference with $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS env variable in setup section
#executed with elevated previleges
#example included below for testing
%setup
    touch /file1.txt #created in the root file system of the host OS 
    touch ${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/file2.txt #created in the root file system of the container OS

#copy files into the container with greater safety than in %setup
# example: <source> [<destination>]
# each line is a pair. <source> can be a path in the host system or a path from a previous stage of the build
# can also specify to copy files during a certain stage: look up further if necessary
%files
    /file1.txt #copy file from host OS root to container root
    /file1.txt /opt #copy file from host OS root to /opt in the container  

#optional section: may be redundant
#probably won't need for the purposes of iSentry
%app

#download files from the internet with tools like git and wget
#install software and libraries, write config files, create directories, etc
#example commands below
#setting environment variable at build time:
#   redirecting text to $SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT will cause it to be written to a file called /.singularity.d/env/91-environment.sh, 
#   which is then sourced at runtime    
%post
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat
    NOW=`date`
    echo "export NOW=\"${NOW}\"" >> $SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT

#runs at the very end of the build process to validate the container, user specified
#can skip by building with the --notest option
#use to test if required programs are in the container: 
# example: samtools, which if not in the container will stop the build with output "samtools: command not found"
# To avoid program error codes clogging output stream, can also use syntax "myprog || true"
%test
    samtools
    bwa || true

#allows for defining environment variables that will be set at runtime
#not available at build-time
# At build time, the content of the %environment section is written to a file called /.singularity.d/env/90-environment.sh inside of the container.
#At runtime, scripts in /.singularity/env are sourced in order. This means that variables in the %post section take precedence over those added via %environment.
%environment

#Contents of this section are written to a file within the container at build time. 
#this file is executed when the "instance start" command is issued
%startscript

#contents of this section are written to a file within the container that is executed when the container image is run
#when the container is invoked, arguments following the container name are passed to the runscript
#$NOW was set in the post section
#$* options passed to the container at runtime as a single string
#$@ options passed to the container at runtime as a quoted array
%runscript
    echo "Container was created $NOW"
    echo "Arguments received: $*"
    exec echo "$@"

#used to add metadata to the file /.singularity.d/labels.json within the container.
#general form is a "name value" pair
#stores metadata
